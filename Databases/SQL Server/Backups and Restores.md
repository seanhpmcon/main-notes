When restoring, ensure a few things are in place:
1. The `.bak` file is in the correct folder.
2. The user has permission to access and restore using that `.bak` file. (Not sure if the user who created the `.bak` file needs to be the one to restore due to permissions)
3. In the Options setting check, the first and last boxes.
