Serial Communication Protocols -> https://circuitdigest.com/tutorial/serial-communication-protocols

### Types of Serial Communication Protocols
1. SBUS
2. PPM
3. JTAG
4. UART
5. 12C
6. CAN
7. SPI
8. MIDI
9. USB
10. RS-232

### Difference between serial communication and serial communication interface
UART is a protocol for serial communication, while RS-232 is a standard that defines the physical aspects of the serial communication interface. UART and RS-232 are often used together, with UART handling the data serialization and deserialization, and RS-232 providing the electrical and mechanical specifications for the physical connection.
