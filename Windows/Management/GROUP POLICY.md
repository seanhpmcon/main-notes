Microsoft’s Group Policy Object (GPO) is a collection of Group Policy settings that defines what a system will look like and how it will behave for a defined group of users.

Microsoft provides a program snap-in that allows you to use the Group Policy Management Console ([GPMC](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/Group-Policy-Management-Console)). The selections result in a Group Policy Object. The GPO is associated with selected Active Directory containers, such as sites, domains or organizational units ([OU](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/organizational-unit-OU)). The GPMC allows you to create a GPO that defines registry-based polices, security options, software installation and maintenance options, scripts options and folder redirection options.
