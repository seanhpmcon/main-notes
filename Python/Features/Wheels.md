Python wheels are a pre-built binary package format for [Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/) modules and libraries. They are designed to make it easier to install and manage Python packages, by providing a convenient, single-file format that can be downloaded and installed without the need to compile the package from source code. They are designed to replace the older egg format and provide a number of benefits over eggs and other package formats, such as easier installation and better support for versioning and dependencies.
